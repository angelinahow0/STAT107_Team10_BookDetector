## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}

library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(textclean)
harry_potter <- read_file("Harry Potter All Books.txt")

hp_clean <- harry_potter %>%
  tolower() %>%
  replace_non_ascii() %>%
  str_squish()

hp_df <- tibble(text = hp_clean)
hp_words <- hp_df %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)

```
